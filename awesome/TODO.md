TODO
====

* Fix color theme handling in hotkeys_popup. 
  - It seems to ignore background or border, for example.
  - xresources fails if it doesn't find the color

* Make scripts more robust when environment variables are missing

* Simplification of the dropdown stuff
  - move dd-list into apps-list. 
  - handle documentation dropdowns.
