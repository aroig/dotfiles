helm-mu
=======

Helm sources for searching emails and contacts.  The sources require a
fully configured mu4e setup and the latest version of mu (version from
Sept 27 2013 or later).  Mu is an indexer for maildirs and mu4e is a
mutt-like MUA for Emacs build on top of mu.  Mu is highly efficient
making it possible to get instant results even for huge maildirs.  It
also provides search operators similar to Google mail, e.g:
`from:Peter to:Anne flag:attach search term`

To search for emails use `helm-mu` and to search for contacts use
`helm-mu-contacts`.
