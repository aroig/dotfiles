* Setup easier bindings for fugitive, parallel to the ones in emacs.

* Gdiff: add easier local bindings during a 3-way merge session.

* Gdiff: add key bindings for Gwrite to keep an entire version in a 3-way merge.

* Fix colors. `DarkGray` (on the background of visual mode) is not visible on kernel ttys.
