;;; Commentary:

;; Helm sources for searching emails and contacts using mu and
;; mu4e. Mu is an indexer for maildirs and mu4e is a mutt-like MUA for
;; Emacs build on top of mu. Mu is highly efficient making it possible
;; to get instant results even for huge maildirs. It also provides
;; search operators similar to Google mail, e.g:
;;
;;     from:Peter to:Anne flag:attach search term

;;; Install:

;; Helm-mu requires a fully configured mu4e setup and the latest
;; version of mu (version from Sept 27 2013 or later).
;;
;; Copy helm-mu.el to a directory in your load-path.  And add the
;; following to your init file:
;;  
;;     (require 'helm-mu)
;;  
;; Alternatively, you can use the autoload facility:
;;
;;     (autoload 'helm-mu "helm-mu" "" t)
;;     (autoload 'helm-mu-contacts "helm-mu" "" t)
;;
;; To run mu, helm-mu uses the function `start-process-shell-command'.
;; It assumes that the shell called by that function is compatible
;; with the Bourne shell (e.g. bash).  If your shell is incompatible,
;; the mu command may not work.
;;
;; GNU sed is used to do some filtering of the results returned by
;; mu.  GNU sed is standard on Linux but OSX users may have to install
;; it since the pre-installed BSD sed has different command line
;; options.
;;
;; Some things that can be configured:
;;
;; - `helm-mu-default-search-string'
;; - `helm-mu-contacts-name-colwidth'
;; - `helm-mu-contacts-name-replace'
;; - `helm-mu-contacts-after'
;; - `helm-mu-contacts-personal'
;;
;; Consult the documentation in Emacs or the source code below for
;; explanations of these variables.

;;; Usage:

;; To search for emails use `helm-mu'.  When you would like to read an
;; email without finishing the helm session, you can select the email
;; and press Ctrl-z.  This will split the screen horizontally and show
;; the email in the new window while keeping the search results in the
;; other.  Alternatively, you can open the email using the enter key
;; and return to the helm session using the command `helm-resume'.
;;
;; To search for contacts use `helm-mu-contacts'.  Note that search
;; terms are interpreted differently by `helm-mu-contacts' than by
;; `helm-mu'.  `helm-mu' assumes that the search terms are complete
;; words, i.e., that they are surrounded by white spaces or
;; punctuation.  So if you search for "jo" it will only return emails
;; in which "jo" occurs as a word.  In contrast to that,
;; `helm-mu-contacts' will return all contacts in which "jo" occurs as
;; a substring.  `helm-mu-contacts' uses the grep tool for
;; searching.  That means that any regular expression supported by
;; grep can be used when searching for contacts.
